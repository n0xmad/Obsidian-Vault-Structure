# Obsidian-Vault-Structure

These are example vault structures for Obsidian in order to optimize Penetration Testing workflow and have easy access to knowledge while in an engagement. The initial structure is based off of the concept TrustSec put forward. Adjustments will be made for my use cases, including a penetration testing guided template when navigating boxes.

To Do:
- [ ] Restructure 0400 - Gen_Note.md
- [ ] Add automated template for Pentest
- [ ] (Possibly) switch out emoji-based tagging
